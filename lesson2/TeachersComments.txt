The condition for EmailPromotion was not "not EQUAL", it was "not INCLUDING".
Correct answer: 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PersonType) AS DistinctCount
FROM Person.Person
WHERE LastName LIKE 'M%' 
		OR NOT EmailPromotion LIKE '%1%'

Color is not needed in the SELECT. After adding it to select, you had to add it to GROUP BY and it gave you incorrect result.
Correct answer:
SELECT  ProductSubcategoryID,
		MIN(Weight) AS Min_weight, 
		MAX(Size) AS Max_size
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ProductSubcategoryID
